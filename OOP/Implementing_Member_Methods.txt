Implementing Member methods
___________________________

_Member methods have access to member attributes, therefore you don't need to
 pass them as arguments. This is how and why getters and setters are used.

_Can be implemented inside the class declaration, implicitly inline

_Can be implmented outside the class declaration need to use:
 Class_name::method_name

_Can seperate specification from implementation
 .h file for the class declaration
 .cpp file for the class implementation
