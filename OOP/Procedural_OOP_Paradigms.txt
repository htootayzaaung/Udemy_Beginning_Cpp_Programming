Procedural Programming
______________________


_Focuses on processes or actions that a program takes
_Programs are typically a collection of functions
_Data is declared seperately
_Data is passed as arguments into functions
_Fairly easy to learn
_It involves breaking a huge task to smaller sub-tasks


Limitations:
____________


As programs get larger they become more:

_difficult to understand
_difficult to maintain
_difficult to extend
_difficult to debug
_difficult to reuse code
_fragile and easier to break


___________________________
Object-Oriented Programming
___________________________


Classes and Objects:
____________________

_focus is on classes that model real-world domain activities
_allows developer to think at a higher level of abstraction
_used successfully in very large programs


Encapsulation
_____________


Information-hiding:
___________________

_implementation-specific logic can be hidden
_users of the class code to the interface since they don't need to know 
the implementation
_more abstraction
-easier to test, debug, maintain and extend


Reusability:
____________

_easier to reuse classes in other applications
_faster development
_higher quality


Inheritance:
____________

_can reuse new classes in term of existing classes
_reusability
_polymorphic classes
