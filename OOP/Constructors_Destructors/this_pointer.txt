"this" pointer

_Contains the address of the object - so it's a pointer to the object

_Can only be used in class scope

_All member access is done via "this" pointer

_Can be used by the programmer:
  _To access data member and methods
  _To determine if two object are the same (more in the next section)
  _Can be dereferenced (*this) to yield the current object
