The Default Constructor
_______________________

_Does not expect any arguments

_Also called the no-args Constructor

_If you write no constructors at all for a class, C++ will generate a Default
 constructor that does nothing.

_Default constructors are called when you instantiate a new object with no
 arguments.

For example,
___________________________
Player frank;
Player *enemy = new Player;
