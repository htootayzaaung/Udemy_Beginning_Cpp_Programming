Section 13 Challlenge
_____________________

For this challenge you are to develop the foundation for a program for which movie fanatics to keep 
track of what moves they have watched and how many times they watched each movie.

The program must support the following:

class Movie - models a movie which includes
- movie name (String)
- movie rating (G, PG, PG-13, R) (String)
- watched -  the number of times the movie has been watched (Integer)

class Movies - models a collection of movie objects

Obviously, "Movies" needs to know about "Movie" since it is a collection of "Movie" object. However, our 
main driver should only interact with Movie class.

For example, a simple main should be able to 
- create a "Movies" object
- ask the "Movies" object to add a movie by providing the movie name, rating and watched count. 
(i.e that is to create a constructor by accepting "movie_name", "movie_rating" and "watched_count")
as the arguments to the constructor.
- ask the "Movies" object to increment the watched count by 1 for a movie given its name.
- ask the "Movies" object to display all of its movies.

Additionally,

- if we try to add a movie whose name is already in the movies collection we should display this error
to the user.
- if we try to increment the watched count for a movue name whose name is not in the movies we should
display this error to the user.
